Bradley Pitts : <i>"A week in e-waste? No better place to spend summer for American artist Bradley Pitts + French programmer Jonathan Tanant. The focus of their residency: a multi-mode, variable-gravity flight simulator of the Russian parabolic-flight aircraft."</i>
</p>
<p>We have been developing this 0g parabolic flight simulator hooking up a custom software written with Unity and XPlane flight simulator, building an installation able to fly and do the maneuvers itself. We also did some research about what good UIs for pilots trying to achieve 0g would be.</p>
